# MatchInARow
**Match-In-A-Row** 
-- JavaScript Canvas Game  
-- This game has user switching colored balls to match 3-in-a-row to score the highest amount of points within a limited amount of moves or the user can choose a time trial to score as much as possible within 30 seconds.



*This game utilizes a canvas that is initialized to show a randomized board of colored balls, as well as, a scoreboard & number of moves left.  'Basic' & 'Time Trial' buttons are pressed to initialize the board and start the game for their respective settings.  The board is represented with a double array that has a ball for each position.  Balls are shown on screen and when the mouse drags a ball to another, the balls switch colors.  When there’s 3-in-a-row (or 4 or 5) either vertically or horizontally, the balls above the matched balls collapse down from the top.  If balls are collapsed and there are balls 3-in-a-row (or more) then they also allow more balls to collapse.  When the balls fall down, an animation occurs as they fall.  Each ball that is matched is 100 points-per-ball.  When the # of ‘moves left’ reaches zero, the board is cleared, the ending score is shown, & the game goes back to the start screen.  There is a ‘try again’ on the game-over screen.  Javascript contains a style.css for the stylings of the game.  JavaScript files are filed dynamically.  The Basic game is as explained prior; limited moves to try to make the most points.  The Time Trial has the user trying to attain the most points as possible within a time limit (30 seconds w/ no limited moveset).  Once the time runs out, a game over screen is shown.*
